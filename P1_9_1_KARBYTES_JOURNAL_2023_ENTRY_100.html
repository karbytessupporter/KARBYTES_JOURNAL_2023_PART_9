<p>I was horrified to find out that the birth certificate was almost delivered to me but the completion of the delivery required a signature from the receiver. I called my dad on the phone to ask if my social security card arrived in the mail and if the UPS truck arrived at his house. He said that there was no social security card in the mailbox and he said that, around 8AM he heard the doorbell ring and, by the time he arrived at the door to answer, the delivery truck was already leaving (and they left a note saying that they attempted to deliver a package and would try again tomorrow). To ensure that I get that package in time, I am going to take BART back to Castro Valley and walk to my mom&#8217;s house to borrow that car just to ensure that I get to my dad&#8217;s house before 8AM tomorrow (rather than miss tonight&#8217;s work shift in order to do so). I also asked my dad not to park his car in front of my mom&#8217;s Toyota Matrix which I have been borrowing so that I can move it out of the driveway (because it would otherwise be blocked by my maternal grandfather&#8217;s car and my father&#8217;s car). It&#8217;s a little after 6PM now and I am near the East Dublin BART station after eating some food which I bought from the Whole Foods (and I keep coming here almost daily because I like this location and the people who work here and coming here is the closest thing to &#8220;coming home&#8221; for me (and I do not like to spend too much time in Castro Valley because, without my old friends and sense of optimism about my future and lack of relative hardships, being in Castro Valley triggers my existential angst to a severe extent because I feel &#8220;too old&#8221; to still be living at my parents&#8217; houses and, also, I feel like I had to re-start my adult identity following a series of life-changing events in late 2015: my breakup with Spencer, my dropping out of California State University East Bay, and my three-year contract-based internship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ending)).</p>
<p>My plan tonight is to drive the car to work in Fremont and to leave around 6AM so that I can be present to sign the delivery of my birth certificate at my dad&#8217;s house. Also, I found out that the start times for my job changed and get updated on a daily and/or weekly basis only after being told to come into the office because I failed to clock out for lunch (which is technically considered to be &#8220;time theft&#8221;). Now I know to always clock out at lunch to avoid getting in trouble. Also, I am not the only Sunrise Shift employee who clocked in last night at 1AM instead of 2AM (and that employee said that he was told that the Saturday shift is optional for those who want to get extra hours). I will just keep showing up at 1AM every weekday and disregard the notices on the wall which I took photographs of with my phone and included in this web page below.</p>
<p>I am sitting in a field where I here the roar of nearby freeway traffic, the croaking of frogs, and the occasional honking of Canadian geese (which flock to this region to relax in the grass and to bathe in the large puddles). Above me is a clear sky with a waxing moon which is approximately 25% full and stars (and the glow of the sunset is still visible near the west horizon).</p>
