<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_117</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This might as well be the most important journal entry I have ever written thus far. That is because it is very honest and very direct.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I do not know why there has been a war waging for many months in Ukraine (which was seemingly initiated by just one human being: Vladimir Putin) other than the fact that to go to war for almost any reason is something humans and other primates have been doing for thousands of years (which means war is more of an unconscious and automatic reflex than a conscious and well-thought out decision). Sending donation money to Ukrainian civilians who have lost their homes, sustained injuries, and lost loved ones seems only marginally helpful. I think Vladimir Putin should have been detained and maybe even assassinated as a means to stop that war.</p>
<p>I could cite many examples of preventable human-caused emergencies which humans are currently plagued by and suffering greatly from while business goes on as usual (because the human world seems to revolve primarily around the flow of money and the goods, services, and games which are involved in financial transactions and other behaviors pertaining to transporting or else storing money).</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll never catch my breath,&#8221; is some random fictional character&#8217;s lament which sounds like me and what I think many (if not most) other humans sound like (especially people who barely earn enough money to get by at best while working multiple jobs and not getting what I think is sufficient time to rest, recover, and continue pursuing an education and doing other activities which would make those people smarter, happier, healthier, and better able to utilize their resources than what seems to be the status quo). What I think is going is that most humans are merely coping and surviving while discouraging themselves and others from risking their reputations, economic security, and physical safety doing things that are necessarily counter-culture in order to bring about desired change in human civilization or, at the very least, communicate to oneself and others about what one&#8217;s personal values and ethics are (i.e. virtue signaling).</p>
<p>What good is virtue signaling if it is ineffective to induce large-scale change in society? I think that virtue signaling is better than not virtue signaling because the former means that one is at least willing to express what one cares about (regardless of whether or not other people approve or share similar ideals) while the latter means that one is basically hiding in order to appear humble, non-controversial, easy-going, uncomplicated, and appeasing to locals in order to avoid being punished or otherwise inconvenienced. (The only exception to that is if a person is being held captive in a violent and abusive government or organization and that person wants to avoid being violently tortured, maimed, and murdered). Not expressing what one cares about (i.e. not being authentic about what one&#8217;s preferences are) seems to make the world a less happy place because it deprives people of good examples of how to live in a counter-culture instead of merely socially conformist manner.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if people make fun of me for choosing to adhere to a vegan diet instead of eating animal products with reckless abandon like they do. That doesn&#8217;t mean I am going to chastise them for their choices (and I rarely criticize people to their face unless they ask me to or if their choices are seriously impeding my welfare). I do not mind being ridiculed as a &#8220;soy boy&#8221; or a &#8220;princess&#8221; merely because I have personal standards I would rather not forsake merely to be accepted in a social group.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if people make fun of me for walking instead of driving a car and for sleeping outside instead of indoors. I like being alone and I like being outside. Most of my inspiration comes from observing the world around me. It never ceases to amaze me. Also, all that walking helps keep me physically and mentally fit and prevents me from feeling claustrophobic as a result of being cooped up in a small container for too long and for too often. I love being alone more than being in a household with other people because it is the only guaranteed way that I will be able to avoid being limited by other people&#8217;s lifestyles. For example, by living outside, I get to decide where to sleep and what time. Living at someone else&#8217;s house means that, if they want to throw an all-night party, I will not be allowed to sleep unless I wear $300 noise canceling headphones or go outside the house to sleep.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">In the past I have said things which I think now sound a bit out-of-date or not well supported by empirical evidence gleaned from first-hand experience and from other communicating with other people (either by talking to them directly or else by consuming the media they produce).</span> I hope that my audience will allow me to mature and change as a person and not keep insinuating that I ought to remain stagnant in my personal evolution. Sadly, some people seem to be adamant about treating me like I am less mature and more mentally fucked up than I really am. Perhaps they get more benefit from demonizing me and hence justifying treating me in a derogatory and ostracizing manner than being supportive and open minded. That&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t need such people to treat me in any particular way (except for not stealing or vandalizing my property nor physically injuring me).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">One of my main goals in life is to take up other people&#8217;s time, attention, concern, money, and other resources as little as possible (unless those people consent to giving me some or all of those things). Thank you very much for your VOLUNTARY contribution of valued resources. I do not intend to take any more from you than I think you are able and willing to give me.</span></p>

Perhaps they get more benefit from demonizing me and hence justifying treating me in a derogatory and ostracizing manner than being supportive and open minded and non-judgmental (thought that is a tall order to ask of humans when they are genetically programmed and culturally indoctrinated to be xenophobic, tribalistic, and easily amused by petty fighting and gossip). That&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t need such people to treat me in any particular way (except for not stealing nor vandalizing my property nor physically injuring me).</p>
<p>(What is &#8220;need&#8221; other than just a very high priority &#8220;want&#8221;? The previous sentence is a rhetorical question. It is meant to remind myself and others that nature does not necessarily need its contents to be any particular way unless that particular configuration is what actually occurs (which seems to be me using the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naturalistic fallacy</a> to justify that whatever does exist or whatever has transpired &#8220;should&#8221; have occurred because the only condition for something to be good and worthwhile is that nature allowed that thing to happen)).</p>
<p>(I suppose it is better for me to say that, rather than &#8220;need&#8221; people to treat me a certain way, I prefer that people treat me a certain way).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">Lastly (but not least), one of my main goals in life is to be a sentient part of nature and to, at times, recognize my intrinsic and immutable oneness with nature. (At present, my worldview is <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychic</a> (which means that I think that all of reality is contained inside of one mind)).</span></p>
<p>One last blurb before I close up this chapter and open up the next one: I know that I said in an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_106/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier journal entry</a> that I did not want to seal up chapter nine until I had at least two code pages added to my primary website. I got one of those code pages done and it took several weeks. I would rather put this chapter behind me because it contains a lot of what I think is unsavory and &#8220;low brow&#8221; content I would rather not have to keep revisiting. Hence, it is time for me to move on to &#8220;better&#8221; things. See you on the other side!</p>
