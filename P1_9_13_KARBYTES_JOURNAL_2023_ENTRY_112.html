<p>Today I rented a hotel room at the Motel 6 near East Dublin BART station for one night (and I am typing this note inside of that room right now).</p>
<p>Rather than extend my hotel stay for one more night (which is approximately $100 per night), I decided to start renting a small unit at the Public Storage near the Trader Joe&#8217;s grocery store on the border of Castro Valley and Hayward for approximately $70 (and apparently I am legally required to pay insurance to keep my stuff there for approximately $15 per month). My move in date for that Public Storage unit is tentatively set for tomorrow (and gate access hours are between 6AM and 9PM daily).</p>
<p>(Documents related to my Public Storage unit rental have been uploaded to one of my private GitHub repositories for future reference. I do not feel comfortable sharing my Public Storage account data publicly online because I am afraid someone will try to impersonate me with that data and possibly steal or vandalize property).</p>
<p>I am also going to experiment with using the public laundry mat near the the UPS store in Castro Valley in the Lucky&#8217;s grocery store shopping center region as an alternative to going to my parents&#8217; houses to wash my clothes. Today I bought some &#8220;quick dry&#8221; clothes (i.e. black shorts with a skin-tight chartruse inner layer and a black T-shirt) from the Walmart about half an hour&#8217;s walk from where my hotel room is so that I have something to wear while my other clothes get washed and dried. I figure that I can get by showering no more often than once per week at a hotel. Probably closer to the end of the year I will rent a mailbox at the aforementioned UPS store.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The purpose of this journal entry is to document the ways I can effectively move out of my parents&#8217; houses without having to rent a housing unit (as a &#8220;professional homeless person&#8221;). If I implement the strategies which I documented in this journal entry, then it is possible for me to be functionally homeless such that I can hold down a job, not have to carry all of my material possessions with me at all times, not have to let my hygiene deteriorate to an &#8220;unprofessional&#8221; level, and not have to depend on friends and family instead of on commercial and government services.</span></p>
<p>(For the record, I do not plan on bringing any of my stuff which, last time I checked, is located in &#8220;my&#8221; room at my dad&#8217;s house (or in &#8220;my&#8221; mailbox at my dad&#8217;s house) to my new Public Storage unit. It will appear that I effectively vanished from that neighborhood perhaps forever. It is possible and likely that I might never go to either one of my parents&#8217; houses again).</p>
