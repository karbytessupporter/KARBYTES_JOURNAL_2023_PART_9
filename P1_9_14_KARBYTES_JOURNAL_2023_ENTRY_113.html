<p>Today I tried calling the Public Storage I made a reservation for a small storage unit at in order to cancel my reservation and to possibly get a refund on the two months of rent I accidentally paid for (and I only attempted to pay for one of those months but an error on the Public Storage website made it seem like I did not submit the first payment (so I ended up making the same payment twice while initially thinking I only made it once)). Even during business hours no human answered the phone (but I did leave a message).</p>
<p>After that, I called the phone number on the debit card which was issued to me by Patelco and was able to relatively quickly and easily get those two payments of approximately $52 each to Public Storage refunded.</p>
<p>Finally, I made an appointment to pick up my new driver&#8217;s license from the Pleasanton Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) so that I can use that new driver&#8217;s license (which will display my legal address instead of Spencer&#8217;s old address) to rent a Post Office box and have packages sent there instead of to my legal address (but in order to rent a P.O. box, I need to bring proof of residence (and I had almost all the documents I needed last time I attempted to rent a P.O. box at the UPS store in Castro Valley except for a driver&#8217;s license with an address which matched a print-out of one of my Patelco bank statements))).</p>
<p>(Screenshots of email messages and website activity which pertain to these transactions has been added to one of my private GitHub repositories in case I need to look up that information in the future).</p>
<p>Since I &#8220;have to&#8221; presumably go to my dad&#8217;s house (which has been my current legal address of residence since 2016 (and before that the only other place I legally lived at was my mom&#8217;s house)) to pick up my driver&#8217;s license, I am planning on walking there today to see if my social security card arrived (and maybe to get a little drum practice in). On my way back to Pleasanton/Dublin, I tentatively plan on using the laundry mat right next door to the UPS store in Castro Valley to do some laundry (using a small bottle of detergent which I will keep stowed away under a bush or something (because I do not have much room in my backpack and because I do not want that liquid to spill on my electronics, clothes, and papers)).</p>
