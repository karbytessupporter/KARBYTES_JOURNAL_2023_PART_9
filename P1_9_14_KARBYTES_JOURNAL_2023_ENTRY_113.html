<p>Update: I bought some laundry detergent from the Whole Foods Market in Dublin (and some food and drink items). Then I rode the BART train to Castro Valley. While I was waiting for the train to arrive, it started raining lightly and then progressively more heavy (off and on). I also noticed an interesting looking man who exuded a quiet intelligent demeanor; merely standing on the platform and not doing anything other than patiently waiting (and he seemed serene, thoughtful, and natural). (I have an embarassing tendency to fidget and look anxious (and I blame the Thought Police for that because they seem opposed to me being as relaxed, happy, and engaged in something non-trivial and non-filibuster-y as I would be without their buzz kill interference). When we both got onto the same train car, I saw him pull out a paper book and he started reading it. I pulled out my phone and looked at Instagram. We both got off the train at Castro Valley BART station.</p>
<p>Then I walked past the Farmer&#8217;s Market in the BART parking lot and eventually to the laundry mat in the Lucky&#8217;s supermarket. I saw that I needed to put quarters into the machines. There were approximately five customers in there doing their laundry. I decided against using that laundry mat last minute. I also decided to forgo getting a post office box. I decided that the chances of my mail getting intercepted at my dad&#8217;s place is not very high and that subscribing to a tiny post office box which is too small to recieve packages such as replacement backpacks is a waste of my money. Also, I do not mind just using the washing machine and dryer machine at my dad&#8217;s house (even though I am afraid some articles of clothing will get stolen because that is what happened several times in the past).</p>
<p>(As I was walking away from the laundry mat and towards my dad&#8217;s house, my mom called me on the phone to let me know that she needed to use the Toyota Matrix which is parked in her driveway because her BMW is having issues. I said that I do not expect to need the Toyota Matrix any time in the future. <span style="background:#ffff00">As &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; and &#8220;counter-cultural&#8221; as it is for me to attempt to live without a car I either own or else borrow, I think it is the most cost-effective, environmentally-conscious, and low-stress commute option (especially given the fact that I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and have access to the BART train system, Lyft, et cetera)).</span></p>
<p>If you are wondering why I said in the previous journal entry that I might not be going back to my parents&#8217; houses, I said that because I was momentarily obsessed with &#8220;living on my own&#8221; (because I have some recurring thoughts which suggest that I deserve to be treated like a wayward child until I officially move out of my parents&#8217; houses). In retrospect, I think that is some lame cultural brainwashing which does not make much rational sense given how prohibitively expensive the cost of living is in the San Francisco Bay Area. I currently do not make enough money to do much other than pay rent for a room in someone else&#8217;s house (which is about $800 per month while an apartment would cost me at least $1,500 per month).</p>
<p>What DOES make sense is me buying a Walmart bicycle as soon as I can afford one. Then, after I can afford a Cyclepath bicycle, stow the cheaper bike at home as a backup bike while using the other bike as my main commuter.</p>
<p>If I learned anything during this weekend it is that I am literally &#8220;on track&#8221; with my goals (and I have yet to disclose the relevent details because I want to wait until the very laste minute to showcase milestone accomplishments so that my blog is more of a &#8220;done list&#8221; than a &#8220;to do list&#8221;).</p>
<p>Lastly, if anyone wants to know why I would rather minimize how often and how long I visit Castro Valley in favor of hanging out in Fremont or in Dublin, it is because I feel more at home in those other cities than I do in Castro Valley. Basically, I live like a homeless person even though I technically have a home so that I can (a) spend most of my time living alone and (b) so that I can spend most of my time in public places which I think are most conducive to studying and relaxing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today I tried calling the Public Storage I made a reservation for a small storage unit at in order to cancel my reservation and to possibly get a refund on the two months of rent I accidentally paid for (and I only attempted to pay for one of those months but an error on the Public Storage website made it seem like I did not submit the first payment (so I ended up making the same payment twice while initially thinking I only made it once)). Even during business hours no human answered the phone (but I did leave a message).</p>
<p>After that, I called the phone number on the debit card which was issued to me by Patelco and was able to relatively quickly and easily get those two payments of approximately $52 each to Public Storage refunded.</p>
<p>Finally, I made an appointment to pick up my new driver&#8217;s license from the Pleasanton Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) so that I can use that new driver&#8217;s license (which will display my legal address instead of Spencer&#8217;s old address) to rent a Post Office box and have packages sent there instead of to my legal address (but in order to rent a P.O. box, I need to bring proof of residence (and I had almost all the documents I needed last time I attempted to rent a P.O. box at the UPS store in Castro Valley except for a driver&#8217;s license with an address which matched a print-out of one of my Patelco bank statements))).</p>
<p>(Screenshots of email messages and website activity which pertain to these transactions has been added to one of my private GitHub repositories in case I need to look up that information in the future).</p>
<p>Since I &#8220;have to&#8221; presumably go to my dad&#8217;s house (which has been my current legal address of residence since 2016 (and before that the only other place I legally lived at was my mom&#8217;s house)) to pick up my driver&#8217;s license, I am planning on walking there today to see if my social security card arrived (and maybe to get a little drum practice in). On my way back to Pleasanton/Dublin, I tentatively plan on using the laundry mat right next door to the UPS store in Castro Valley to do some laundry (using a small bottle of detergent which I will keep stowed away under a bush or something (because I do not have much room in my backpack and because I do not want that liquid to spill on my electronics, clothes, and papers)).</p>
