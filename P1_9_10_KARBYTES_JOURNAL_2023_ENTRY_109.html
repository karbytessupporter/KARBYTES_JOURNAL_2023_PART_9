<p>Within the past two weeks I read some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_103/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">articles</a> about the advancement of the cultured meat industry. I&#8217;m not as interested in the prospect of eating meat as I am in the application of cultured isolated animal tissues and organs for replacing damaged body parts in medical procedures which appear to me to have the potential to extend a human&#8217;s lifespan indefinitely and to keep a human being as healthy and functional as a non disabled and healthy 25 year old human.</p>
<p>I read somewhere online that people are considering making a novelty food industry which essentially pertains to harvesting a few cells from a celebrity&#8217;s body (which does not necessitate harming the celebrity) in order to grow a limitlessly abundant supply of celebrity meat for eating, erotic pleasure (e.g. growing just the vagina of a porn star to sell to consumers who would like to have a realistic experience of what it might be like to have sex with that porn star), and physiological augmentation (e.g. to replace one&#8217;s own faulty eye ball with the pristine blue eye of a beloved celebrity).</p>
<p>I personally am no longer crave eating meat like I used to back when I was younger, dumber, and more hedonistic. As someone who seems to have a higher than average interest and understanding of how ecology on Planet Earth works, I see eating meat as generally unnecessarily high maintenance (because it costs disproportionately many resources to grow meat from slaughtered animals than it does to produce plant based alternatives to meat) and, therefore, unattractively infantile. I am hoping that, once psychedelics become more culturally mainstream and available to the general public, humans will start to, in droves, lose their desire to consume meat for the same reasons I have lost mine.</p>
